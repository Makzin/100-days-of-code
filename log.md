# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 3 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the JS calculator.

**Thoughts** Struggling with the general calculations what should happen when someone enters more than one operator (for example, divides 2 numbers, then multiplies the result). Continuing to dig through.

### Day 2: January 4 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the JS calculator.

**Thoughts** Got frustrated with the spaghetti code in the calculator logic so ripped it all out and wrote a bunch of pseudo-code scenarios. Starting to code this tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 5 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JS calculator!

**Thoughts** After doing some research on 'how have others', turns out it was WAY easier to work with strings and use JS's native eval() function. Not sure how 'clean' this is (Codepen warns against using eval()), but it works! On to the next one :)

### Day 4: January 6 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the JS Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts** Started reading up on how JS handles time and thinking about how this can be built into a countdown timer.
