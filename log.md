# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 3 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the JS calculator.

**Thoughts** Struggling with the general calculations what should happen when someone enters more than one operator (for example, divides 2 numbers, then multiplies the result). Continuing to dig through.

### Day 2: January 4 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the JS calculator.

**Thoughts** Got frustrated with the spaghetti code in the calculator logic so ripped it all out and wrote a bunch of pseudo-code scenarios. Starting to code this tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 5 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JS calculator!

**Thoughts** After doing some research on 'how have others', turns out it was WAY easier to work with strings and use JS's native eval() function. Not sure how 'clean' this is (Codepen warns against using eval()), but it works! On to the next one :)

### Day 13: January 18 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the TicTacToe game

**Thoughts** All done! Some minor bugs (including color switching of symbols). Generally don't feel too good about this code, too many jquery fades etc. Anyway, should refactor this in the future. Running a bit low on Javascript energy, so I don't even know if I'll start the Simon Game next.

### Day 14: January 19 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning PHP!

**Thoughts**
After talking to a co-worker on a good project to work on, he recommended that I build a blog application from scratch using PHP and MySQL. Given my recent burnout with Javascript, I figured I would take a short break to go and learn PHP before coming back to the Simon Game.
