# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 3 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the JS calculator.

**Thoughts** Struggling with the general calculations what should happen when someone enters more than one operator (for example, divides 2 numbers, then multiplies the result). Continuing to dig through.

### Day 2: January 4 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the JS calculator.

**Thoughts** Got frustrated with the spaghetti code in the calculator logic so ripped it all out and wrote a bunch of pseudo-code scenarios. Starting to code this tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 5 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JS calculator!

**Thoughts** After doing some research on 'how have others', turns out it was WAY easier to work with strings and use JS's native eval() function. Not sure how 'clean' this is (Codepen warns against using eval()), but it works! On to the next one :)

### Day 12: January 17 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue on TicTacToe game

**Thoughts** Almost done TicTacToe game. All that's left is implementing the 'draw' mechanics.

### Day 13: January 18 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the TicTacToe game

**Thoughts** All done! Some minor bugs (including color switching of symbols). Generally don't feel too good about this code, too many jquery fades etc. Anyway, should refactor this in the future. Running a bit low on Javascript energy, so I don't even know if I'll start the Simon Game next.

### Day 14: January 19 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning PHP!

**Thoughts**
After talking to a co-worker on a good project to work on, he recommended that I build a blog application from scratch using PHP and MySQL. Given my recent burnout with Javascript, I figured I would take a short break to go and learn PHP before coming back to the Simon Game and continue with JS.

### Day 15: January 24 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Been continuously learning PHP on both Codeschool and TeamTreehouse, there's a lot to go through. Set up a server with DigitalOcean, installed the LAMP stack on it, got a MySQL server up and running.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit frustrated with the slower progress, which is normal given that I'm learning an entirely new syntax, as well as doing server-side programming for the first time. PHP is really interesting so far, I like how it works sequentially (none of the async stuff JS has). It is REALLY strict though (spent 20 minutes tracking down a missing semi-colon). Also, need to get used to mixing php and html syntax, which can get... finicky (lots of quotation marks, lol). Treehouse has proven to be a much better resource than CodeSchool in this regard. Also been thinking about signing up for Launchschool.com, which focuses very in-depth on Ruby and Rails. However, after speaking to a few co-workers AND doing some quick googling, it seems like a much better idea to get a good grasp on PHP to really get a solid understanding of how it all works (having your website interact with the DB and the server). Ruby on Rails seems to have too much 'magic' happening under the hood. It optimizes for speed and to get up and running fast, which is neat, but not what I'm looking for. I need a solid understanding of the core mechanics before I can start utilizing magic tricks. I want to apply this to my Javascript learning as well. Frameworks like React look really neat, but without getting a good core understanding of Javascript I feel like I'd be screwing myself over in the long run.

None yet.

### Day 16: January 30 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress** Rebuilt MaxVL.com from scratch in PHP and set up a 'blog' section. Connected it to a DB and am able to successfully query it for article content! Next up, protecting against SQL injection attacks and learning how to actually add entries into the DB.

**Thoughts**
Pretty hopeful so far! It's been an interesting ride with PHP and I'm still not sure how in-depth I want to really learn this stuff before tackling something like say Launchschool. There's this nagging doubt that I'm not learning things in depth enough, and that I don't know where to dig deep. Do I spend weeks/ months looking deeper into PHP and everything that comes with it? Or do I follow a more set path and pay others to determine my progress? I like Wyatt's suggestion about getting exposure to 'basic' things like connnecting to a DB, setting up user authentication, etc for free doing the things I'm doing now.  I still believe that once I've set up the blog and feel good about it I might move on to the Launchschool curriculum (after finishing up the front-end piece of FreeCodeCamp). The whole Mastery-based learning approach really speaks to me.

In other thoughts: my CSS still sucks hardcore - I really need to learn that shit from the fundamentals. Just reworking some of the stuff on MaxVL is sort of 'change value, see the change, change value again' without really understanding what's happening.

I also started thinking about attending things like Hackathons. It seems like a really good idea, even as a beginner, so start going to these things - even if I don't know much. Still will take a lot of willpower to attend, so I'm not really sure at this point. There's DEMENTIAHACK in March, which seems cool but I don't know if I'll be able to contribute much to either the 'issues' or the actual code, knowing what I know.

AAANd another stream of thought is contributing to open source. I understand it's all the rage and you're encouraged to get into that as soon as possible - but not even sure if I can with the skills I have. I mean, basic PHP and Javascript? Are there even new, beginner-geared open source PHP projects? I mean, I'm sure there are. I guess this is the same thing every code newbie runs into.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to porting this stuff over onto the blog once it's ready.

### Day 17: February 1 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Learned all about CRUD in PHP.

**Thoughts**
Followed a TreeHouse tutorial that taught me how to create records in a DB table, which is awesome! Since I need to learn how to actually insert blogposts into my DB. Next, I need to actually build a form that'll allow me to input some blog text, as well as a date. Having done the filtering input and sanitizing output part twice now, it's starting to become a bit more familiar and much less abstract. Still a bit fuzzy on when you would need to prepare queries, but I think practice will help here.
Still looking to get through the blog application in PHP before starting in earnest on the LaunchSchool Ruby stuff.

### Day 18: February 2 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Updated the blog to accept new posts and write them to the DB

**Thoughts**
Figured out how to take form input and post that to the DB. Still working through some issues (like how to get the article_id to auto-increment) as well as somehow set the proper date and subject (which currently isn't happening). Gotta debug that tomorrow.

### Day 19: February 4 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
Learned more about the command line

**Thoughts**
Reading a book by LaunchSchool about the CLI, probably will be going over it a few times or print out a list of the commands.


**Link(s) to work**

### Day 20: February 9 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Learned more about the command line - specifically around Files, Directories and executables.

**Thoughts**
Reading a book by LaunchSchool about the CLI, probably will be going over it a few times or print out a list of the commands. Also started making a flashcard deck on BrainScape. Not really made much progress with the php blog, since the TeamTreehouse videos now just go through stuff that I don't really understand. I mean, I can code along with their video just fine, but I don't understand what I'm writing.It's exactly the same problem I have with other material as well (such as bootcamps, etc). They just have you write stuff without understanding why you're writing it in full.

Hoping to get some time away from it - starting on the LS stuff. I might come back to the blog and finish it for the sake of finishing it, however, I find little value in that if I don't understand exactly what I'm doing.

### Day 21: February 14 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Finished book about the command line, started exercises in Ruby.

**Thoughts**
Continuing on the learning path, I think it makes more sense to start the LaunchSchool curriculum now and really study to the point of mastery. I can try the self-teaching free approach for a while longer, but if I don't really fully understand what I'm doing than I'm just spinning my wheels. It's no use having built some toy apps if I'm still stuck staring at a blank editor when tasked to build something.

Ruby's not my first choice when it comes to language (after having sort of started with Javascript), but it's the language LaunchSchool is using. Also, from everything I've read, first language doesn't really matter as the core programming concepts remain the same agnostic of the language.
